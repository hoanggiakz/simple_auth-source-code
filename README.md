# Lab 6 - Simple Authentication in Node.js

This lab demonstrates two authentication methods using Node.js and Express:  
1. **Basic Authentication** (with hardcoded username/password).  
2. **Cookie-based Authentication** (with session cookies stored in MongoDB).  

The source code is provided by the lecturer. Below are the instructions to run and test the APIs using **Postman**.

---

## Part A: Basic Authentication

### 1. Run the Server
```bash
node basic_auth.js
Server will run on: http://localhost:3000
Test with Postman
(a) Public Routes
In file Public/img you will see results 1a.img
GET http://localhost:3000/ â†’ response: Welcome! Visit first public resource.

GET http://localhost:3000/public â†’ response: Welcome! Visit second public resource.
(b) Protected Route

GET http://localhost:3000/secure

You must add Authorization header in the request:

Key: Authorization
Value: Basic base64(username:password)


Example with username=admin, password=12345:

Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46MTIzNDU=
ðŸ‘‰ Valid credentials:

You have accessed a protected resource ðŸŽ‰


ðŸ‘‰ Invalid credentials:

403 Access denied.


ðŸ‘‰ No credentials:

401 Authentication required.

## Part B: Cookie Authentication
1. Run the Server

Start MongoDB first:

mongod


Then run:

node cookie_auth.js


ðŸ‘‰ Server will run on: http://localhost:3001

2. Test with Postman
(a) Login (to receive cookie)

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:3001/login

Body (JSON):

{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "12345"
}


ðŸ‘‰ Response: Logged in!
ðŸ‘‰ Cookie auth_cookie_token will be set (check in Postman tab Cookies).

(b) Access Protected Route

Method: GET

URL: http://localhost:3001/profile

ðŸ‘‰ With valid cookie:

Welcome user 1, your cookie is valid.


ðŸ‘‰ Without cookie / expired cookie (after 5 mins):

401 Unauthorized

(c) Logout

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:3001/logout

ðŸ‘‰ Response:

Logged out.


ðŸ‘‰ Cookie will be removed from browser and deleted from MongoDB.
Summary

Basic Authentication: Uses Authorization header with Base64 encoded credentials.

Cookie Authentication: Uses login to create a session stored in MongoDB, client must send cookie to access protected routes.
